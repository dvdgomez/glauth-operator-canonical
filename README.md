# Glauth Operator

Glauth provides a lightweight LDAP server with configurable backends.

This operator builds a simple deployment of the Glauth server and provides a relation interface such
that it can be integrated with other Juju charms in a model.

The charm's documentation is viewed on [Charmhub][charm-docs] and its bugs are tracked on [Launchpad][charm-bugs].
